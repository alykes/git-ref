# Valuable git commands

##Setting up git
```git config --global user.name "first.last"
git config --global user.email "user@domain.com"```

* To set values for a specific project, drop --global
```git user.name "first.last"
git user.email "user@domain.com"```


##Listing variables
```git config --List```

* To list specific variables
```git config user.name
git config user.email```

##Help
```git help <config/commit/etc>```

## Initialising a new repo
Run the command from the directory you wish to host the new repo in
```git init```

## Set up a repo on github
Add the remote origin to the local repo, so that you can push/pull changes

```git remote add origin https://github.com/alykes/git-ref.git```

## Push changed up to the remote repo
```git push -u origin main```

## Status of the local repo in comparison to the origin/master
The results will let you know if there is anything to commit and what has and hasn't been staged.
```git status``
For a briefer response
```git status --short``` or ```git status -s```

## Add file(s) to the repo
* Add a single file
```git add <file.name>```
* Add multiple files
```git add .```

### Reminder Tip
When you *add* a file, it is in a _STAGED_ state
When you *commit* a file it is in the _COMMITED_ state

## Diff command
* To compare files STAGED (*add*ed) with the last commit snapshot
```git diff --staged```
* To tell git not to treat files as copies of one another
```git diff --staged --no-renames```

* To compare the difference in the working directory with what is STAGED (*add*ed)
```git diff```

## Commit changed
```git commit -m "A description of the changes made"
* Shortcut to skip stages -a
```git commit -a -m "A description of the changes made"

## Push changes
* Push locally commited changes up to the remote master
```git push origin master``` ```git push origin main```
